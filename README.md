Archive of Umitweak Chiru, a (outdated) console conversion for Umineko no Naku Koro Ni Chriu

I've stumbled upon the fact that most torrents of this mod are now dead, and only one remaining mirror existed. I haven't seen any live links for WTC3 yet, but I will be uploading that too as soon as I can.
I believe these are an important part of WTC history and should be preserved!
