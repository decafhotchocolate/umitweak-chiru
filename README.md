# umitweak-chiru
Archive of Umitweak Chiru, a (outdated) console conversion for Umineko no Naku Koro Ni Chiru

I wish to stress, I had zero hand in the creation of this patch. This is purely for archival purposes.

I've stumbled upon the fact that most torrents of this mod are now dead, and only one remaining mirror existed. I haven't seen any live links for WTC3 yet, but I will be uploading that too as soon as I can.

I believe these are an important part of WTC history and should be preserved!

If you would like to install the patch, you can visit this page for info.
